cortex
======

Virtual scratch pad and brainstorming tool, with collaboration.

Sometimes you **just** want to type up some really quick ideas.

You **don't** want to have to:

 - login
 - sign up
 - give someone your email address
 - fill out a captcha
 - login with your facebook/twitter account
 - worry about keeping it private
 - provide a list of users who can access it
 - worry about saving it for later
 
...or really anything else. Sometimes **all** you want is a virtual scratch pad that anyone can add to. Nothing more.

That's what **cortex** gives you.

*Virtual scratch pad and brainstorming tool, with collaboration.*

Sometimes you **just** want to type up some really quick ideas.

No logins required. No "trial" period. No limits on the number of pages you can create.

Just go to the page and start typing. Why does it have to be more complex than that?
